## Installation
1. Fork / clone this repository.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm run start:dev` to start your server in development mode.

Use `npm start` to run the application. If you deploy this application, create a `.env.production` file similar to the `.env.development` file.

## Existing files

The table below describes the folders in this starter repository:

| Folder/file path | Description                                                      |

## Database setup

1. Set up four new ElephantSQL database instances - development, test, preview, and production.
1. After setting up your database instances, connect DBeaver to your new database instances.

### Knex

Run `$ knex` commands from within the `back-end` folder, which is where the `knexfile.js` file is located.

## Running tests

Test are split up by user story. You can run the tests for a given user story by running:

`npm run test:X` where `X` is the user story number.

Have a look at the following examples:

- `npm run test:1` runs all the tests for user story 1 (both frontend and backend).
- `npm run test:3:backend` runs only the backend tests for user story 3.
- `npm run test:3:frontend` runs only the frontend tests for user story 3.

### Frontend test timeout failure

Running the frontend tests on a resource constrained computer may result in timeout failures.

If you believe your implementation is correct, but needs a bit more time to finish, you can update the `testTimeout` value in `front-end/e2e/jest.config.js`. A value of 10000 or event 12000 will give each test a few more seconds to complete.

#### Screenshots

To help you better understand what might be happening during the end-to-end tests, screenshots are taken at various points in the test.

The screenshots are saved in `front-end/.screenshots` and you can review them after running the end-to-end tests.

You can use the screenshots to debug your code by rendering additional information on the screen.
